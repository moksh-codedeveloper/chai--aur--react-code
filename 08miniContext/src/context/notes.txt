UserContext

it will become the provider 
    which means every component globally be accessible to this context 
    <UserContext>
        <Login />
        <Card>
            <Data/>
        </Card>
    </UserContext>
like this 


for children 

children is just like an outlet 
keep footer and header as it is 
like that the props you are getting use them as it is 
children is just generic name pass out as it is as coming to you
